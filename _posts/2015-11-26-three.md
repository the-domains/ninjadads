Well well well...

I've made the third post.  I'm not usually good at just randomly writing stuff to put on posts, but I suppose that's what blogging is.  If I could spend an hour of each day sitting in a cafe drinking coffee and just writing my thoughts I'd be all over it!  Sadly, while I have an amazing cafe and bistro downstairs ([www.amibistro.co.uk][0] if you're interested) the opportunity to sit about all hipster like with my apple device and write my musings is unlikely.

He says, as he sits here typing his musings...

Really.  I'm just testing what it looks like when thegrid.io is used to make a website.  It's a test - I've got the chance to make seven websites using this system and I can barely think of one!  I've got projects on the go, but they're structured - and this seems, well, too bloggy.  There's no structure, there's no rules, there's no feeling of support.  It's like a brave new world where no-one knows what's going to be.. There's a robot, sorry AI developer looking at my stuff and deciding where it should go, and whilst I'm okay with that, the control-ly part of me is worried that I'll not have a say.

I'm going to shove a picture into this post, it's a large picture.. I want to know what George - that's what I'm going to call my AI developer - is going to do with it.. I have a feeling it'll look like my hang-dog expression from post two, but we'll see.

mmm.. mussels!  Who doesn't like mussels.. especially with chips and a chilli roll freshly made that morning.  By the way, you'll appreciate that I take food pictures for the bistro downstairs, so rather than upload pictures of my children - which scares me (people out in the world, not my children... although, thinking about it...) I'll put some foodie pictures up instead.

Right.  Enough for today.. lets see what George has in mind for this post!
