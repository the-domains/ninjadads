This is my first post

No idea what it's going to be about but it's a good place to start!  See - this is my first day using the grid.  I don't really know what to think.. There are limited instructions - it feels a bit like one of those point and click to escape games where you have to find out what each button does by clicking it.  Which, for me, sums up the entire "the grid" philosophy.  Keep telling a bunch of people that have paid you money that something is coming, it's going to be big, and to keep the faith.  Then when that thing arrives, be as elusive about how to use it as you have been about when it's actually going to be live.

I'm sure it'll be awesome - at the moment I like the lack of detail, as if something is working in the background busily putting every letter I type onto a giant piece of paper and organising where it thinks they should go.

Which for me, as a messy, chuck it anywhere and something good will happen, kind of guy - is EXACTLY what I wanted.

Come on robot Grid thing.. do something awesome :)
